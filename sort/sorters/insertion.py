    Insertion Sort
    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=
    A much much much faster algorithm that takes advantage
    of the relations of the input array. It also gets faster 
    as more of the array is sorted â€” much faster than a
    linear relationship.
    Algorithm 2.2 in the book. Java implementation @pg 251.

    Publicly Callable Methods
    ================
    load(data:list)->list  Loads an array into the sorter's memory
    sort()->list  Sorts and returns loaded data, empties the sorter's memory

    Class Callable (Unexposed) Methods
    ================
    _swap(indxA, indxB) -> None  Swaps two indexes of the array loaded
    _check() -> bool  Checks if array in memory is sorted

        # descending order starting from the current digit
        # which is for looped backwards until (maximumly), zero.
