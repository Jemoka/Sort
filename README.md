# Sort
This is a *simple* (and, hopefully clear) demonstration of sorting algorithum and definitely not one that is production ready. You are invited to explore the (hopefully) well annotated code and see for yourself.

The sorting implementations are based on the Java work from Sedgewick and Wayne in their wonderful book *Algorithms, Fourth Edition*. This is purely an educational exercise in implementing those algorithms. Enjoy!
